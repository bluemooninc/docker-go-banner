## 8. Specification

- Banner Display Period Conditions

  Each banner is associated with a promotion.
  Therefore, each banner will only run for a specific period of time.
  Ensure the display period can be set individually for each banner.

- Banner Display Rules

  If the banner is within the display period, display the banner.
  The banner display rules should be timezone aware.(UTC)
  Only one banner can be displayed at a time.

- Internal Release & QA Considerations

  Weâ€™d like to display the banner if the user has an internal IP address (10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 127.0.0.1 as test), even if the current time is before the display period of the banner.
  After a banner expires, it should not be displayed again.
  During QA, there may be occasions where two banners are considered active. In this case, the banner with the earlier expiration should be displayed.
